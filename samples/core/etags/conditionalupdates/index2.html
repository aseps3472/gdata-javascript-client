      <h2>Conditional Updates in Contacts Using the Google Data JavaScript Client</h2>
      <p>This sample shows you how to use etags and the "If-Match" header to
      make updates and deletes.  The two iframes below show you the contacts in
      your "JavaScript Client Sample" Contact Group (If there aren't any
      contacts, use the "Create New Contact" link to create a few new contacts).</p>
      <p>After adding a few contacts, Use the edit button to edit one of the 
      contacts.  Once that contact updates, try updating the same contact in 
      the other window.  You should receive an error indicating an etag mismatch.
      At this point, you can either click "Reload Contacts" to grab the latest
      updates to the contacts, or check the "Force update/delete?" checkbox. 
      The "Force update/delete" checkbox sends an "If-Match: *" header to the server.
      This header tells the server to ignore any recent changes to this contact
      and force the update.</p>
      <p>Play around with various combinations of updates and deletes between
      the two windows to get a sense of how etags work.  When you are finished
      with this sample, you can delete the "JavaScript Client Sample" Contact Group
      from you contacts.</p>
